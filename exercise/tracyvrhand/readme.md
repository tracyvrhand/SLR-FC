Here are five articles related to hand detection:

1. **On-Device, Real-Time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe**: This article explains how MediaPipe, an open-source cross-platform framework, uses machine learning to infer 21 3D keypoints of a hand from a single frame, providing high-fidelity hand and finger tracking. The article also provides a detailed overview of the ML pipeline used for hand tracking and gesture recognition ¹.

2. **GitHub Topics: Hand Detection**: This GitHub repository contains 132 public repositories related to hand detection. The repositories include code for finger detection and tracking using OpenCV and Python, blendshape and kinematics calculator for Mediapipe/Tensorflow.js Face, Eyes, Pose, and Finger tracking models, and more ².

3. **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Finger Segmentation**: This article presents a novel real-time method for hand gesture recognition. The method involves extracting the hand region from the background using the background subtraction method, followed by segmenting the palm and fingers to detect and recognize the fingers ³.

4. **Hand Detection and Tracking in Real Time**: This article explains how to detect and track hands in real-time using OpenCV and Python. The article provides a detailed overview of the hand detection and tracking pipeline, including hand segmentation, feature extraction, and classification ².

5. **Hand Detection and Tracking using Deep Learning**: This article explains how to detect and track hands using deep learning techniques. The article provides a detailed overview of the hand detection and tracking pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation ².

I hope this helps!
